Welcome to Guy the AI. Guy was created to assist the Gainesville community in choosing what to eat at El Indio, a local mexican restaurant revered by many as a Gainesville gem. Since the menu is so broad, guy is able to answer questions ranging from hours of operation to locations and even prices of toppings and special food items.
